## Mako – Live Handling & Execution Guide

This handbook defines **what to do, when to do it, and what to say** during real-world handling.

It is the **authoritative execution layer** of the system.

If there is ever a conflict between files, **this document wins**.

---

## 0. How to use this handbook

- This is **not theory**
- This is **not training philosophy**
- This is **handler choreography**

If Mako is reacting to a real stimulus, you follow this document.

---

## 1. Core cues (verbatim — do not change wording)

These words are **frozen**.  
Do not substitute synonyms.

### “I got this”
- Primary disengage cue
- Means: *You do not need to evaluate or act*
- Tone: calm, low, boring
- Used:
  - after movement begins during sudden triggers
  - to interrupt fixation
  - during sound training (timing differs)

---

### “come Mako”
- Movement anchor
- Ends sniffing
- Exits zones
- Re-centers attention

May be paired with light leash pressure if needed.

---

### “ok”
- Verbal release cue
- Used to end static behaviors (sit, down, place)
- May be replaced by light leash pressure when appropriate
- Not used under arousal

---

### “sniff”
- Permission marker
- Used to:
  - label sniffing as it begins, or
  - grant sniffing after compliance
- Sniffing is decompression, **not entitlement**

---

### “eh eh”
- Mild early interruption
- Paired with leash signal
- Neutral tone
- Used once per attempt

---

## 2. Timing rules (non-negotiable)

These rules apply to **all real-world handling**.

### Core timing rule
**Body first. Words second.**

- Pressure and movement create state change
- Words explain what just happened
- Never speak during resistance

---

### Pressure rule
- Apply only what is needed to create movement
- Release pressure as soon as movement exists
- Do not maintain pressure once feet are moving with you

---

### Cue stacking rule
- One cue at a time
- Do not stack cues under arousal
- Movement > obedience when arousal rises

---

## 3. Intervention ladder (live use)

Used in **compressed environments** and early escalation.

### Level 1
- Leash signal + “eh eh”
- Purpose: interrupt trajectory early
- Used **once**

---

### Level 2
- 180-degree turn
- Smooth, decisive
- No verbal correction required
- Used **once**

---

### Reset condition
- Engagement returns
- Leash softens
- Scanning decreases

Do not continue escalating after reset.

---

## 4. Sudden trigger choreography (sound / surprise)

This is the **most important sequence** in the system.

### When a sudden sound or trigger occurs:

1. Apply pressure and turn
2. Get 1–3 steps of movement
3. Release pressure
4. Say **“I got this”**
5. Continue moving

Do **not**:
- correct the sound
- ask for sit/down
- wait in place
- talk before movement

---

## 5. Fixation handling (live)

### Definition
Fixation = stopping movement and locking attention, failing to disengage on first interruption.

---

### First fixation
### First fixation
- Move first (step in, turn, walk away)
- Say **“I got this”** after movement starts
- Continue session

Continue session.

---

### Second fixation (same session)
- Session ends
- Calmly go inside

No third category.

---

## 6. Sniffing rules (important)

Sniffing is a **tool**, not a right.

### Allowed
- after compliance
- away from trigger zones
- during decompression phases

---

### Not allowed
- in hot zones
- near fences or corners
- during heightened arousal

---

### Ending sniffing
- Say **“come Mako”**
- Light leash pressure if needed
- He must disengage cleanly

Do not negotiate.

---

## 7. Immediate zone protocol (outside the house)

This is the highest-risk area.

### Rules
- Short leash
- No sniffing
- Early Level 1 interruptions
- Level 2 if orientation locks
- “I got this” after movement begins

Goal: **extract from territory**, not perfect behavior.

---

## 8. Walk philosophy (live)

- Forward position allowed
- Loose leash required
- Heel is a tool, not a default
- Movement keeps arousal down

Direction changes and 180s are acceptable for:
- engagement
- interruption
- preventing fixation

---

## 9. Relationship to sound training

Sound training:
- is offline
- is controlled
- uses the same words
- may differ slightly in timing (because you control the trigger)

During real-world events:
- you are **managing**, not training
- do not try to “apply” sound training live

---

## 10. Success markers (what progress looks like)

- Faster disengagement
- Shorter fixation
- Less pressure required
- Quicker recovery indoors
- Fewer interventions needed

Neutrality comes last.  
**Recovery speed comes first.**

---

## Final rule

If Mako is reacting to a real stimulus, you are managing — not training.

Training happens before problems.  
Interventions happen during problems.  
Recovery happens after problems.

This handbook governs the *during*.
