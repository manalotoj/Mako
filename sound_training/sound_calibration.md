# Sound Calibration Model (Stepwise)

This system uses **stepwise calibration**, not full-spectrum calibration.

Calibration is treated as **purposeful exposure**, not neutral measurement.
Every sound exposure must either:
- train a response, or
- inform the next decision

There are no “just testing” reps.

---

## Why full calibration is avoided

A full sweep from barely audible to escalation:
- introduces unintended desensitization
- reduces novelty
- shifts sensitivity mid-session
- blurs measurement vs learning

For confident, fast-learning dogs, this degrades training quality.

## Core rule

> **Never expose the dog to a sound level you are not prepared to train at that day.**

## Stepwise Calibration Model

### Step 1 — Choose a conservative starting level
Start at a volume where:
- the sound is clearly perceived
- no startle occurs
- recovery is immediate

This is your **initial working level**.

You do NOT need to identify:
- perception floor
- startle threshold
- escalation ceiling

Those will emerge naturally.

---

### Step 2 — Train only at the current level
Run sound-training sessions exclusively at this level until:
- recovery becomes faster
- orientation to handler improves
- less movement or pressure is needed

Do not increase volume within a session.

---

### Step 3 — Recalibrate before progression (single-step probe)

Before moving up:

1. Play current working volume **once**
2. Observe recovery
3. Increase volume slightly
4. Play **once**
5. Observe response

This is a **micro-recalibration**, not a ladder test.

Total exposures: 2.

### Step 4 — Decide immediately

#### You may progress if:
- startle is mild or brief
- movement still works
- recovery occurs within a few seconds
- no barking, freezing, or fixation appears

#### Do NOT progress if:
- vocalization occurs
- fixation appears
- recovery slows
- pressure required increases

If progression fails:
- return to previous level
- resume training there
- do not retry higher volume that day

---

## Calibration frequency

- Initial calibration: implicit (choosing first working level)
- Recalibration: **only before progression**
- No full re-mapping unless environment or context changes significantly

---

## Important notes

- Sensitivity will fluctuate day to day
- Progression is based on **recovery speed**, not silence
- Different sounds progress at different rates

This model prioritizes learning quality over speed.
