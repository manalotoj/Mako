# Sound Training — Doorbell

Doorbells are **predictive and territorial**.
They require a different approach than dog barking.

The goal is to install a **movement-based replacement pattern**.

---

## Goal

Change:

> Doorbell → guard / bark / hold ground

to:

> Doorbell → follow handler away from door

---

## Phase 0 — Install movement pattern (no sound)

Before any doorbell sound:

1. Say **“I got this”**
2. Turn
3. Walk 6–10 steps away from door
4. Pause
5. Verbal release or food scatter

Repeat daily until this pattern is automatic.

---

## Phase 1 — Low-volume doorbell recording

### Setup
- Use a recording
- Very low volume
- Same movement pattern as Phase 0

### Sequence
1. Doorbell sound
2. “I got this”
3. Turn and move away
4. Pause → release

Do NOT wait for barking.

---

## Phase 2 — Stepwise progression

Use the **stepwise calibration model** before each increase.

Progress more slowly than dog barking.
Doorbells carry more emotional weight.

If barking appears:
- volume is too high
- drop back one level next session

---

## Phase 3 — Realistic volume

- Short reps only
- Fewer repetitions
- Stop as soon as recovery is clean

This phase is for proofing, not learning.

---

## Phase 4 — Real doorbell (controlled)

When ready:
- Have someone ring once
- Immediately execute movement pattern
- Do not open door until disengagement is complete

Doorbell never equals confrontation.

---

## What NOT to do

- No sit-stay at door
- No holding position while aroused
- No corrections for barking
- No opening door during escalation

Those reinforce guarding.

---

## Success indicators

- Immediate movement away from door
- Reduced barking attempts
- Faster recovery
- Less intensity over time

Doorbell training progresses slower than bark sounds.
That is expected and correct.
