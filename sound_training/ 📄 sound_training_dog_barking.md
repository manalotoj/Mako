# Sound Training — Dog Barking (GSD-style)

## Goal

Change the reflex from:

> Bark sound → alert / protect / orient outward

to:

> Bark sound → orient to handler → move → recover

This protocol targets **auditory startle and orientation**, not social interaction.

---

## Setup

- Location: indoors or neutral room
- Away from doors, windows, yard
- Dog on leash initially
- Speaker placed to feel external (not “from handler”)
- Session length: 2–4 minutes

Train one sound type per session.

---

## Working Level Selection

Use `sound_calibration.md` to choose a starting volume.

The correct level:
- is clearly perceived
- does not cause startle
- allows immediate recovery

---

## Training Sequence (core loop)

For each repetition:

1. Play bark sound
2. Immediately say **“I got this”**
3. Move 3–5 calm steps away
4. Stop
5. Wait for body softening
6. Optional food scatter or sniff

No sit.
No down.
No heel.

Movement is the intervention.

---

## Repetitions

- 5–8 reps per session
- 1–2 sessions per day
- Stop while it is still easy

---

## Progression

Before increasing volume:
- perform stepwise recalibration
- advance only one increment

If a higher volume causes:
- barking
- freezing
- fixation

Drop back and stay at the current level.

---

## Signs of progress

- Ears flick instead of lock
- Head turns to handler faster
- Recovery <5 seconds
- Less movement required
- Lower leash pressure over time

Neutrality comes last.
Latency reduction comes first.

---

## Common errors to avoid

- Waiting for reaction before intervening
- Asking for obedience during sound exposure
- Increasing volume mid-session
- Mixing sound types in one session

Dog barking sound training is about **reflex recovery**, not suppression.
