# Sound Triggers (Growls / Sudden Barks)

Sound triggers are reflexive before cognition.

## Correct response
1. Turn away and initiate movement
2. Get 1–3 steps of movement
3. Say **“I got this”**
4. Continue moving
5. Resume only after body softens

No corrections.
No obedience cues in the moment.
