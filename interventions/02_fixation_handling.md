# Fixation Handling

## Definition
Fixation = stopping movement and locking onto the corner,
failing to disengage on first interruption.

## Rules
1. First fixation → move away first, then verbal disengage
2. Second fixation in same session → end session, go inside

No third category.

## Indoors
- remove visual access
- neutral movement or food scatter
- crate only if settling fails

Crate = nervous system reset, not punishment.
