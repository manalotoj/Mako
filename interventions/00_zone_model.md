## Zones of arousal and control

Mako’s behavior is managed using three operational zones.
These zones describe **decision state**, not emotion.

---

### Green zone — engaged and available

**Definition**
- responsive to handler
- able to disengage voluntarily
- decisions remain flexible

**Handler role**
- guide
- reinforce
- allow autonomy within rules

**Allowed cues**
- “yes”
- “sniff”
- “let’s go”
- “ok”

**Goal**
- reinforce good choices
- maintain low baseline arousal

---

### Yellow zone — fixation forming

**Definition**
- attention narrows
- scanning or fixation appears
- decision is forming but not yet executed

**Handler role**
- interrupt
- transfer responsibility
- prevent escalation

**Primary tools**
- movement
- leash pressure
- direction change

**Allowed cues**
- “I got this” (after movement begins)
- “let’s go”
- “eh eh” (early interruption)

**Not allowed**
- obedience commands
- reassurance
- punishment markers

**Goal**
- disengage early
- return to green zone

---

### Red zone — loss of self-control

**Definition**
- fixation converts into forward drive
- commitment to action occurs
- handler influence is overridden

This state should be **rare**.

**Handler role**
- stop the behavior
- mark the boundary
- end the situation

**Primary tools**
- decisive physical interruption
- immediate extraction

**Allowed cue**
- **“no”** (single, assertive marker)

**Not allowed**
- repeated cues
- negotiation
- obedience requests

**Goal**
- mark the decision as unacceptable
- prevent repetition
- move immediately to recovery
