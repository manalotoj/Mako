# Intervention Ladder (Immediate Zone)

Used just outside the house and other compressed environments.

## Level 1 — Leash signal + “eh eh”
Purpose: interrupt trajectory early.

Use when:
- pace increases
- leash loads
- head or ears orient outward

Brief, neutral, immediately released.

## Level 2 — 180-degree turn
Purpose: break orientation and force state change.

Use when:
- Level 1 fails
- commitment is building
- environment compresses

Smooth, decisive movement.
No verbal correction required.

Rule: each level is used once before escalation.
