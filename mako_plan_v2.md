# Mako – Reactivity, Fixation, and Handling Plan (v2)

This document is a **practical, handler-level operating plan** for managing and training Mako’s selective reactivity, fixation, territorial sound triggers, and arousal patterns. It reflects refined handling decisions, clear intervention ladders, and context-specific rules.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **This is not fear-based reactivity**

   * Mako is confident, decisive, and protective.
   * His reactions arise from *decision-making under arousal*, not panic.

2. **The goal is responsibility transfer**

   * Mako does not decide whether action is needed.
   * The handler owns assessment, movement, and disengagement.

3. **Management is training**

   * Calm, uneventful reps matter more than exposure.
   * Preventing rehearsal is more important than working through triggers.

4. **Context determines cue density**

   * High cue density is appropriate in training sessions.
   * Low cue density is required in trigger-rich environments.

---

## KEY CUES AND TOOLS

### “I got this” — Primary disengage cue

* Calm, low, boring tone
* Means: *You do not need to evaluate or act*
* Used immediately after sound triggers or to interrupt fixation

### “Come Mako” — Movement / disengage cue

* Clean disengagement from sniffing or lingering
* May be paired with light leash information if needed

### Sniffing

* Used as **decompression**, not entitlement
* Permission-based
* Labeled as it begins (“sniff”), then later granted after compliance

---

## INTERVENTION LADDER (IMMEDIATE ZONE NEAR HOME)

This ladder is used **just outside the house and in other compressed, high-risk areas**.

### Level 1 — Leash signal + “eh eh”

**Purpose:** Interrupt trajectory while arousal is still low.

Use when:

* pace increases
* leash begins to load
* head or ears start to orient outward

Execution:

* brief leash information
* neutral “eh eh”
* immediate release

Each level is used **once** before escalating.

---

### Level 2 — 180-degree turn

**Purpose:** Break orientation and force a state change.

Use when:

* Level 1 does not land
* commitment is building
* environment is compressing (gate, corner, neighbor proximity)

Execution:

* decisive, smooth turn
* no verbal correction required
* continue moving until engagement returns

“I got this” may be layered **after** movement if needed.

---

## FIXATION HANDLING (BACKYARD / CORNER)

### Definition of fixation

* Stopping movement
* Locking onto the corner
* Failing to disengage on first handler interruption

### Rules

1. **First fixation**

   * “I got this”
   * Step in, turn body, move away
   * Continue session

2. **Second fixation in the same session**

   * Session ends
   * Calmly bring him inside

No third category. No arguing with fixation.

### Indoors after session

* Remove visual access (doors, blinds)
* Neutral state change (leash walk inside, food scatter, place cue)
* Crate only if he cannot settle after these steps

Crate = nervous system reset, not punishment.

---

## LOW GROWL FROM NEIGHBOR DOG (EXTERNAL SOUND TRIGGER)

### What it is

* Reflexive, threat-coded auditory stimulus
* Nervous-system spike precedes cognition

### Correct response

1. “I got this” immediately
2. Turn away from the corner
3. Move 3–10 steps minimum
4. Short but loose leash
5. Resume activity only after body softens

No corrections. No obedience cues in the moment.

---

## BARKING

* Mako’s single bark is intentional, not reflexive
* Barking itself is not corrected
* Focus is on preventing escalation or repetition

---

## MARKING (ENVIRONMENTAL COMMENTARY)

### Guiding principle

Marking is **information sharing**, not a right.

### Allowed

* First elimination of the walk
* Neutral public or common areas

### Blocked

* Neighbor property
* Fences and corners near home
* Known trigger zones

### How to block

* Early Level 1 leash signal + “eh eh”
* Keep moving

Do not over-restrict; structured permission prevents frustration.

---

## OFF-LEASH POLICY

* No casual off-leash freedom
* No long line required

### If off-leash is allowed

* Sterile environment only
* Structured sequence:

  1. Sit
  2. Unleash
  3. Release cue
  4. 2–5 minutes freedom
  5. Recall while engaged
  6. Leash calmly
  7. Pause, then move on

---

## MID-DAY STRUCTURED TRAINING SESSION (7–10 MINUTES)

**Purpose:** Cognitive engagement, responsibility outsourcing, and controlled fatigue.

Typical sequence:

* sit
* touch (hand target)
* push object (ball)
* down
* place
* heel
* front / left / right positions

High cue density is appropriate here.

### End-of-session decompression

* Finish with “find it” (food scatter)
* Encourages sniffing, head-down posture, and parasympathetic activation

This session supports calmer afternoon walks and does **not** replace decompression walks.

---

## WALKING PHILOSOPHY

* Forward position is allowed
* Loose leash is required
* Scanning and fixation are not allowed
* Movement > obedience under arousal

Heel is a tool, not a default.

---

# MORNING WALK ROUTINE — DECOMPRESSION

**Goal:** Lower baseline arousal and set rhythm for the day.

### AM Pre-Walk (5–7 minutes)

This is **state-setting**, not proofing.

1. Threshold pause (30–60 sec)

   * Leash on, door/gate closed
   * Wait for soft body and steady breathing

2. Light engagement

   * 2–3 sits → release
   * 1 down → release
   * Short forward steps, then stop

3. Micro direction changes

   * Gentle arcs or turns
   * No sharp 180s unless needed

Exit only when leash is loose and scanning has stopped.

### AM Walk

* Loose leash
* Forward position allowed
* Sniffing encouraged (permission-based, capped)
* Low verbal density

**Commands are allowed** if engagement drops:

* Single neutral cue (“Mako” or “come Mako”)
* Then return to quiet movement

### AM Triggers

* “I got this” + gentle direction change
* Keep moving

---

# AFTERNOON WALK ROUTINE — STRUCTURE & CONTROL

**Goal:** Remove decision authority and prevent escalation.

### Pre-Walk (mandatory)

* 3–5 minutes structured warm-up
* Sit / down / direction changes
* Short heel bursts

### Hot Zone Near Home

* Use intervention ladder
* No sniffing
* No stopping
* Extract from territory

### Main Walk

* Forward loose leash
* Patterned movement (pace changes, turns)
* Sniffing only after stressors and away from fences

### Triggers

* Early signs: Level 1 or Level 2 intervention
* Sound triggers: “I got this” + movement

### End of Walk

* Calm final minute
* Neutral entry

---

## WHAT PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE

* Shorter fixation duration
* Earlier response to leash information
* Fewer escalations to Level 2
* Faster recovery after sound triggers
* Reduced carryover arousal indoors

---

## FINAL MINDSET

You are not teaching Mako that other dogs are harmless.

You are teaching him:

**“I handle threats. You follow instructions.”**

Clarity, predictability, and early intervention—not suppression—are what reduce reactivity over time.
