# Mako Handling & Reactivity Plan

This repository contains a **handler-level operating system** for managing Mako’s selective reactivity, fixation, territorial sound triggers, and arousal patterns.

This is not a generic training plan.
It is a **decision-transfer and state-management system** designed for a confident, high-threshold dog.

---

## Core idea

Mako’s reactivity is not fear-based.

It arises when:
- arousal increases
- responsibility shifts to him
- environmental triggers demand interpretation

This system prevents that shift by:
- removing decision-making opportunities
- prioritizing movement over confrontation
- separating training, management, and recovery contexts

## Repository structure and how to use it

Each top-level section serves a **distinct purpose** and should not be mixed with the others.

### `principles/`
**Why the system works**

- Mental models
- Responsibility transfer
- Context vs arousal
- Cue density rules

Read occasionally to recalibrate mindset.

---

### `interventions/`
**What to do in real time**

- Intervention ladder
- Fixation handling
- Sound-trigger handling
- Marking rules
- Off-leash policy

Used **during live situations**.

---

### `routines/`
**What we practice daily**

- Morning decompression walk
- Afternoon structured walk
- Mid-day training session
- Backyard protocol

These are scripted, repeatable activities.

---

### `recovery/`
**What to do after arousal spikes**

- Post-trigger recovery
- Indoor reset
- When (and when not) to crate

Used after difficult moments to restore baseline.

---

### `sound_training/`
**Proactive nervous-system retraining**

- Stepwise sound calibration
- Dog barking sound training
- Doorbell training

⚠️ Sound training is **never mixed** with real-world trigger handling.
It is done in controlled sessions, away from actual triggers.

---

### `appendices/`
**Usability helpers**

- Quick reference
- Terminology

Start with `appendices/quick_reference.md` for daily use.

## Guiding rule

> If Mako is reacting to a real stimulus, you are managing — not training.

Training happens **before** problems.
Interventions happen **during** problems.
Recovery happens **after** problems.

Keeping these separate is what makes the system work.
