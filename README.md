# Mako Handling & Reactivity System

This repository contains a **handler-focused operating system** for managing Mako’s selective reactivity, fixation, sound triggers, and arousal.

This is not a generic training plan.
It is a **timing- and wording-sensitive system** built for real-world use.

## Why this system exists

This system did not come from theory or a training framework.
It emerged from lived experience and repeated real-world constraints.

The [storyline.md](storyline.md) explains the observations and decisions that shaped the operating system.
---

## How to use this repo (important)

There is **one live execution context** and **multiple supporting contexts**.

If you mix them, the system degrades.

---

## Core files (start here)

### [handbook.md](handbook.md)
**Primary operational document**

- exact cue wording
- timing rules
- hot-zone protocol
- intervention usage
- what to do *in the moment*

If you only read one file regularly, it’s this one.

---

### [principles.md](principles.md)
**Mental models only**

- why this is not fear-based
- responsibility transfer
- management vs training
- cue density rules

Read to recalibrate mindset, not during walks.

---

### [recovery.md](recovery.md)
**After-action handling**

- post-trigger recovery
- indoor reset
- when (and when not) to crate

Used after difficult moments to restore baseline.

---

### [appendix.md](appendix.md)
**Quick reference**

- intervention ladder
- fixation rule
- core cues (verbatim)
- terminology

Backup reference when you need a reminder.

---

## Factored sections (use deliberately)

These sections exist to **support** the handbook, not replace it.

---

### [interventions/](interventions/)
**What to do during real-world events**

- intervention ladder (details)
- fixation handling (expanded)
- marking rules
- off-leash policy

These are applied **live**, but explained here in depth.

---

### [routines/](routines/)
**What is practiced daily**

- morning decompression walk
- afternoon structured walk
- mid-day training session
- backyard protocol

Routines reduce decision pressure later.
They are not proofing sessions.

---

### [sound_training/](sound_training/)
**Offline nervous-system shaping**

- stepwise calibration
- dog barking sound work
- doorbell training

⚠️ Sound training is **never mixed** with real-world triggers.
It is done in controlled sessions only.

The goal is **faster recovery**, not silence.

---

## System flow (plain language)

- Principles inform routines
- Routines govern daily life
- Real-world events occur
- Interventions are used *if needed*
- Recovery restores baseline
- Sound training operates offline and reduces future load

There is **one execution path**.
Everything else shapes how heavy that path feels.

---

## Boundary rules (do not violate)

- Do not train during real triggers
- Do not correct sound-startle
- Do not stack cues under arousal
- Do not ask for obedience during recovery
- Do not mix sound training with walks

Clarity between contexts is what reduces reactivity.

---

## Guiding rule

> If Mako is reacting to a real stimulus, you are managing — not training.

Training happens **before** problems.
Interventions happen **during** problems.
Recovery happens **after** problems.

Keep those separate.
