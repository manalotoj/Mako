# Recovery

Recovery is how the nervous system returns to baseline.
It is not punishment and not obedience.

## 1. Post-trigger recovery (immediate)

After a trigger or intervention:

- movement happens first
- pressure softens as soon as movement exists
- verbal explanation follows movement

Typical sequence:
1. move away
2. body softens
3. “I got this” (quiet, explanatory)

Recovery is complete when:
- breathing normalizes
- scanning decreases
- leash tension disappears

Do not rush back into activity.

## 2. Indoor reset (after heightened arousal)

If arousal carries indoors:

1. Remove visual access
   - doors closed
   - blinds adjusted
2. Neutral state change
   - short indoor leash walk, or
   - food scatter (“find it”)
3. Place cue if helpful

The goal is **physiological settling**, not compliance.

## 3. When to crate

Crate use is appropriate only if:
- arousal persists after reset attempts
- pacing or fixation continues
- the dog cannot self-settle

The crate is a **nervous-system reset tool**, not a consequence.

Crating should be:
- calm
- neutral
- boring

Release only after settling occurs.

## 4. What recovery is not

Recovery is not:
- a timeout
- a correction
- a training opportunity
- a chance to “prove” calmness

Recovery ends when baseline returns.
Nothing more is required.
