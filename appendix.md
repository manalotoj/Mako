## Quick reference

### Intervention ladder
- Level 1: leash signal + “eh eh” (once)
- Level 2: 180-degree turn (once)
- Reset when engagement returns

---

### Fixation rule
- First fixation: interrupt and move away
- Second fixation in same session: session ends

No third category.

---

### Sound training rule
- Sound training is offline only
- Never mixed with real-world triggers
- Goal is faster recovery, not silence

---

### Core cues (verbatim)

- **“I got this”**
  - disengage cue
  - used after movement begins
  - explanatory, not corrective

- **“let's go”**
  - movement anchor
  - used to leave zones, end sniffing, re-engage

- **“Mwko, come”**
  - recall cue
  - used to have him come back when off leash

- **“sniff”**
  - permission marker
  - granted at start of sniffing or after compliance
  - not a formal obedience cue

- **“eh eh”**
  - mild early interruption
  - paired with leash signal
  - neutral tone

- **“ok”**
  - verbal release cue
  - used to end static behaviors (sit, down, place)
  - may be replaced by light leash pressure when appropriate
  - not used under arousal
