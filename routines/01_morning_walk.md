# Morning Walk — Decompression

Goal: lower baseline arousal and set rhythm.

## Pre-walk (5–7 min)
- threshold pause
- 2–3 sits → release
- 1 down → release
- gentle direction changes

Exit only when leash is loose and scanning stops.

## Walk
- loose leash
- forward position allowed
- sniffing encouraged (permission-based)
- low verbal density

Single cue (“come Mako”) allowed if engagement drops.
