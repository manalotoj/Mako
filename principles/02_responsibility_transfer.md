# Responsibility Transfer

Responsibility transfer means:

> The handler assesses, decides, and resolves.
> The dog follows movement and instruction.

Autonomy worsens reactivity in confident dogs.

Indicators responsibility has shifted correctly:
- faster disengagement
- reduced scanning
- less marking near home
- quicker recovery after surprises

Avoidance is not failure.
Structure is not punishment.
