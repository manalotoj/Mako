# Core Philosophy

Mako’s behavior is **not fear-based**.

He is confident, decisive, and protective.
Reactivity arises from **decision-making under arousal**, not panic.

## Key beliefs

- Management *is* training
- Calm, uneventful reps matter
- Preventing rehearsal beats exposure
- Suppression increases vigilance
- Clarity reduces responsibility-taking

The goal is not to convince Mako that threats are harmless.

The goal is to ensure **he never decides what to do about them**.
