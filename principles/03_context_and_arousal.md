# Context and Arousal

Cue density must change by context.

## High cue density is appropriate when:
- environment is controlled
- no triggers are present
- cognition is the goal

## Low cue density is required when:
- environment is unpredictable
- sound triggers exist
- arousal is rising

Movement reduces arousal faster than obedience under stress.
