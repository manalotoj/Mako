# Principles

This document defines the mental models behind the system.
It is not a training guide. It explains **why** the system works.

## 1. This is not fear-based reactivity

Mako’s reactivity is not driven by fear or insecurity.

He is:
- confident
- decisive
- protective
- willing to move toward conflict

His reactions arise from **decision-making under arousal**, not panic.

Because of this:
- reassurance does not help
- exposure alone does not help
- suppression increases vigilance

The solution is **clarity and responsibility transfer**, not desensitization through force.

## 2. Responsibility transfer is the goal

The primary objective of the system is to prevent Mako from deciding:
- whether something is a threat
- whether action is required
- how to respond

Those decisions belong to the handler.

When responsibility transfers correctly:
- scanning decreases
- fixation shortens
- recovery accelerates
- interventions become lighter and rarer

Autonomy increases vigilance in confident dogs.
Structure reduces it.

## 3. Management is training

Every uneventful repetition matters.

Preventing rehearsal of unwanted behavior is **more important** than working through triggers.

Avoidance is not failure.
Management is not a crutch.
Calm reps compound.

The system prioritizes:
- preventing escalation
- exiting early
- ending sessions cleanly

Progress is measured by **faster recovery**, not neutrality.

## 4. Context determines cue density

Cue density must match arousal and environment.

### High cue density is appropriate when:
- environment is controlled
- no triggers are present
- cognition is the goal (training sessions)

### Low cue density is required when:
- environment is unpredictable
- sound triggers are possible
- arousal is rising

In high arousal states:
- movement reduces arousal faster than obedience
- stacking cues reduces clarity
- timing matters more than precision

## 5. Words do not create movement

Movement precedes understanding.

Pressure and direction change create state change.
Words explain what just happened.

This ordering is critical:
- body first
- words second
- relief follows movement

This principle applies across:
- real-world triggers
- fixation handling
- sound training
